Enhancing Cyber-Physical System Security Through Vulnerability Analysis

In our interconnected world, cyber-physical systems are vital across various sectors such as transportation, healthcare, energy, and manufacturing. These systems, however, face vulnerabilities that can lead to significant disruptions and security risks.

By tapping into these public resources, The project seeks to enhance the vulnerability analysis process for cyber-physical systems. We will leverage the vast amount of curated vulnerability data available in these repositories, encompassing various hardware, software, and network components commonly used in cyber-physical systems.

The project leverages public vulnerability repositories to improve cyber-physical system security. These repositories contain vast data on known vulnerabilities contributed by the security community. By harnessing this data, we aim to enhance vulnerability analysis for these systems. Through "Enhancing Cyber-Physical System Security Through Vulnerability Analysis," we contribute to cybersecurity, knowledge sharing, and safeguarding critical infrastructure in our interconnected world.
